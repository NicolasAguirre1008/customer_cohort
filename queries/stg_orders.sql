-- View: stg_orders
-- Purpose:
--   Cleaned order-level dataset, enriched with customer + payment details.
--   Grain = one row per order_id.
-- Key columns:
--   - order_id
--   - customer_unique_id
--   - customer_city
--   - order_status
--   - order_purchase_timestamp â†’ activity_date + activity_month
--   - payment_type (from payment_one view)
-- Why we keep it:
--   Standardized order table is the backbone for all joins downstream.
